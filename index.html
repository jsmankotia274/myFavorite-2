        <p>Stick war legacy is my favorite video game to play. Stick War: Legacy is an iOS and Android video game published by Max Games Studios. It is a remake of the original Stick War and the fifth installment to the Stick War series. As a mobile game, Stick War: Legacy was the first game that needed to be downloaded in order to be played.</p>
